                <h3>Hello! My name is Meheer, I want to become one of the best Full-Stack Developer. I love to put my self into my codes while I listen to music. My favorite framework as of now is Node.js and make for backend. I'm really good at learning on my own which is really important for a web developer. I've learnt all of my coding from FreeCodeCamp.org on my own and this was really some long way... But it did really worth the time i spent on this. I love to play basketball and handball, And Call Of Duty mobile is my favorite video game and I love watching anime. Thank you for checking my website out, check my github for many more stuff and also my discord to talk to me!!</h3>
